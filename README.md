## 🚨 Important Setup Instructions

### Firebase Configuration Required

This application requires Firebase configuration to function properly. You need to:

1. **Create a Firebase Project** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage

2. **Get Your Firebase Configuration**:
   - In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings (gear icon)
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" section
   - Click on the web app icon `</>`
   - Copy the configuration values

3. **Create Environment File**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Firebase Admin SDK (for Netlify Functions)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour_private_key_here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL=https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx%40your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

4. **Set Up Firebase Security Rules**:
   - Deploy the Firestore rules from `firestore.rules`
   - Deploy the Storage rules from `storage.rules`

5. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - After updating configuration, clear your browser cache completely
   - Or open the site in an incognito/private window

### Service Worker Cache Issues

If you're experiencing cache-related issues (like loading old domain assets), follow these steps:

1. **Clear All Browser Data**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear storage" and select all options
   - Click "Clear site data"

2. **Disable Service Worker Temporarily**:
   - In Developer Tools > Application > Service Workers
   - Click "Unregister" next to the service worker
   - Refresh the page

3. **Force Refresh**:
   - Use Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) for hard refresh
   - This bypasses cache and loads fresh content
